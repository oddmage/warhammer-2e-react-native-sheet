# warhammer-2e-react-native-sheet
React native project making a Warhammer 2E character sheet app

Started this as a side project, with the first commit you can enter character info (Name, race, careers, etc) and stats (primary and secondary).
They are both dumb and can take almost anything, but if it's numbers it will roll if you click on the stat header.

You should be able to run on android by running the basic command: `react-native run-android`
